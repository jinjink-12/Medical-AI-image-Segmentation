# Medical-AI-image-Segmentation

Dataset : The ACDC dataset, provided by the University Hospital of Dijon, is a specialized set designed for the segmentation of cardiac structures—namely the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium—on short-axis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The training database comprises 100 patients, while the testing database comprises 50 patients. Use this link to download the dataset

There are two type of cardiac structures image. One is a 3D NIfTI image, and the other is a ground truth (GT) image. These two images were used to train a U-Net model, and the predicted images' performances were evaluated by measuring loss and score.
